# meteor compiler for [DeNA JSX](http://jsx.github.io/) - a faster, safer, easier JavaScript 


## Using

1. Install the JSX compiler. Toolkit is released as a npm package, so you can install it with npm install -g jsx.

2. Install packages [baysao:dena-jsx](https://github.com/baysao/meteor-dena-jsx.git) for automatic compile file with extension .jsxx (I need to change .jsx to .jsxx for prevention conflict with core package [meteor/jsx](https://github.com/meteor/react-packages/blob/devel/packages/jsx/jsx-plugin.js))


```sh
    meteor add baysao:dena-jsx
```

3. Put code with extension .jsxx in client code
